# Monadic Validation in Gleam!

```sh
gleam add validate_monadic
```

```gleam
import validate_monadic as validate
```

# Usage

This module is the minimal set of functions around a single type alias for `Result` so it may 
be used as a "validation monad".

The `/examples` folder contains two examples for full usage of this module, using
every method contained in it.
